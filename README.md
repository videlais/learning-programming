# Learning Programming Concepts

Welcome to *Learning Programming Concepts*!

This is a crash course designed to introduce common programming concepts. Its goal is not to teach a particular programming language, although examples from C\# and JavaScript are shown, but more to explain concepts common to many programming languages.

Although divided into chapters, it is designed to be read in two-to-three one-hour sessions with concepts building on each other.
